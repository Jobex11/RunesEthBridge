To host a Vite project with an Express backend in a different folder on Vercel, you can follow these steps:

### Folder Structure Example
```
/my-project
│
├── /frontend      # Vite project folder
│   ├── package.json
│   └── (Vite files)
│
├── /backend       # Express backend folder
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── index.js   # Express app entry
│   └── (Express files)
│
└── vercel.json    # Configuration file
```

### Step 1: Prepare the Vite Frontend

1. **Navigate to your frontend folder** and ensure that your `vite.config.js` is properly set up to handle relative paths and production builds.

2. **Set the build output** for Vite:
   In `vite.config.js`, you might want to specify a custom output directory:
   
   ```js
   export default {
     build: {
       outDir: '../backend/public',  // Output Vite build to backend's public folder
     },
   };
   ```

3. **Build the Vite frontend**:
   Run the build command to generate the production files in your backend's `public` folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up the Express Backend

1. **Ensure Express serves static files**:
   In your Express backend (inside `backend/index.js`), serve the static files from the `public` folder (where Vite outputs its build).

   ```js
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const path = require('path');

   app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

   app.get('*', (req, res) => {
     res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));
   });

   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
   ```

### Step 3: Create `vercel.json`

1. **Set up the `vercel.json` file** at the root of your project to define the deployment settings for both the frontend and backend.

   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "builds": [
       {
         "src": "backend/index.js",
         "use": "@vercel/node"
       },
       {
         "src": "frontend/package.json",
         "use": "@vercel/static-build",
         "config": {
           "distDir": "backend/public"
         }
       }
     ],
     "routes": [
       {
         "src": "/api/(.*)",
         "dest": "/backend/index.js"
       },
       {
         "src": "/(.*)",
         "dest": "/backend/public/index.html"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

- **`builds`:** Defines how the backend (`backend/index.js`) is handled as a Node.js project, and the frontend (`frontend/package.json`) as a static site using Vite.
- **`routes`:** Routes API requests to your Express backend, while serving frontend static files for all other routes.

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Connect your repository** (if it's hosted on GitHub, GitLab, etc.) to Vercel.

2. Once connected, Vercel will automatically detect the `vercel.json` and deploy your frontend and backend accordingly.

3. After deployment, your frontend (Vite) will serve static files, and the backend (Express) will handle API requests.

### Additional Notes
- **Monorepo Setup**: Vercel treats the folder structure as a monorepo, allowing you to build both frontend and backend independently.
- Ensure that all your dependencies are listed in the respective `package.json` files for Vite and Express.

This approach will allow your Vite frontend and Express backend to be hosted together with proper routing on Vercel.
